See the Pictures/MemoryMapping.jpg to see my memory mapping for the GPIO ports and RAM

My GPIO ports are as follows:

Button0 : P9_11, GPIO0_30, GPIO30
Button1 : P9_15, GPIO1_16, GPIO48
Led0 : P9_23, GPIO1_17, GPIO49
Led1 : P9_25, GPIO3_21, GPIO117

Check the pictures folder to see my screenshots for the LCD problems. I had a few difficulties at first getting text displayed on Boris but I think it worked out well!

In order to flip the images, I changed the rotation in on.sh
