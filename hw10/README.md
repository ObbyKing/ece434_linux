I wired up the tmp101 sensor and attached ADD0 to power. The address was then 0x4a. I changed this in temp.js and began plotting data accordingly. Every time you see a spike in my plot it is me putting my finger on the temp sensor. Sometimes I put it on for a longer period of time, sometimes it was short.
