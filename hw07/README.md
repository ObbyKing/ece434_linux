I am going to do the LED matrix graduation cap with Devon Adair. Him and I lived on the same freshmen floor together and we have not had the chance to work together on a project yet.

I installed Blynk on my phone and did the sample exercise as described on the eLinux website. I made a post about a fix I needed to make to leds.js on the google group. This is really cool stuff!

I then made the slider. The settings are as follows

Name: Slider
Output: V11, 0 - 1
Decimals: #.#####
Send Values on Release Only: Off
Show Value: On

This makes the LED change brightness by sliding the slider. I really enjoyed this assignment.
